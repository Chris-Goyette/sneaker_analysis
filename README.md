# StockX Sneaker Analysis

## Project Goals

- **Objective:** To fine-tune my sneaker reselling strategy by zeroing in on the most profitable inventory. I aim to dissect StockX sales data to pinpoint the brands, models (silhouettes), variations (colorways), sizes, and other factors that drive the highest sales and profits.

- **Secondary Goal:** Beyond deriving actionable business insights, this project serves as a platform to exhibit my proficiency in SQL and data analysis, thereby making a compelling case for my skill set to potential employers.
